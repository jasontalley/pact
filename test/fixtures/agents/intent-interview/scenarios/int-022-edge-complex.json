We need ticketing with early bird pricing, promo codes, group discounts, and tiered ticket types (general, VIP, speaker). Sessions have capacity limits and waitlists. Speakers submit proposals that go through a review process. There's a mobile app for attendees with push notifications, interactive maps, networking features where attendees can message each other, and live polling during sessions. Organizers need analytics dashboards showing registration trends, revenue, session popularity, and attendee engagement. Also need check-in via QR codes at the door and badge printing integration."
