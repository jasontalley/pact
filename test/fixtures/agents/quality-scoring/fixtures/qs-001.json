    "reasoning": "Inferred from test evidence in cart.spec.ts: the test suite verifies that adding products to the cart triggers a recalculation of the total price. The test creates a cart instance, adds two items with known prices ($10.99 and $24.50), and asserts that the displayed total equals $35.49. A separate assertion confirms the item count increases from 0 to 1 after each addition. This atom captures a single, observable, user-facing behavior with clear success criteria.",
