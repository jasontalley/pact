    "reasoning": "Derived from auth.e2e-spec.ts: the test suite sends POST /auth/login with invalid credentials and asserts a 401 response. Two separate test cases cover wrong-password and unknown-username scenarios, both expecting identical error messages. This prevents user enumeration attacks by ensuring the system does not differentiate between invalid username and invalid password in its response. The atom is security-critical and captures a single, well-bounded defensive behavior.",
