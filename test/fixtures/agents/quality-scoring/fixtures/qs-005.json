    "reasoning": "Consolidated from the entire profile.spec.ts test suite which covers six distinct describe blocks: profile creation, profile retrieval, profile updates, account deletion, password management, and notification settings. Each describe block tests independent behaviors that should likely be separate atoms. The combination makes this atom difficult to test atomically and violates the single-behavior principle.",
