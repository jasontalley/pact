      "p95 response time across 1,000 sequential search queries is below 200ms with a 100,000-product dataset",
      "p95 response time remains below 200ms when query result sets range from 1 to 500 products",
      "Median (p50) response time is below 100ms across all query patterns",
      "Response times do not regress by more than 20% when the dataset grows from 50,000 to 100,000 products"

    "reasoning": "Derived from search-performance.e2e-spec.ts: the test seeds the database with 100,000 product records and measures query response times across 1,000 search requests with varying result-set sizes. The p95 latency is asserted to be below 200ms. A dataset-scaling test verifies sub-linear regression as catalog size doubles. This atom captures a single quantifiable performance contract — search latency — with four independent measurement dimensions that together prove the system meets its latency SLA under realistic conditions.",
