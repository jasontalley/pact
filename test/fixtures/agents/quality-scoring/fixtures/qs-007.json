    "reasoning": "Derived from search-performance.e2e-spec.ts: the test seeds the database with 100,000 product records and measures query response times across 1,000 search requests. The p95 latency is asserted to be below 200ms. A separate load test scenario runs 50 concurrent search requests to verify the system does not degrade under contention. This atom captures a quantifiable performance contract with clear measurement boundaries.",
