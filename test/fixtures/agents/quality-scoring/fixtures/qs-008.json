    "reasoning": "Extracted from payment.controller.spec.ts: the test mocks the StripeGateway dependency and verifies the controller calls stripe.charge() with the expected payload. A second assertion checks that the repository's save method is called with a Payment entity. The test is coupled to the StripeGateway class name, the payments table structure, and the controller class — all implementation details that could change without affecting the user-facing behavior of processing a payment.",
