# The Intent-Centric Software Manifesto
We believe software has entered a phase shift.
For fifty years, software was defined by human execution.
Code was scarce. Typing was expensive. Intent was compressed, informal, and lossy.
That world no longer exists.
Execution is now abundant.
Mechanism is cheap.
Iteration is infinite.
Intent is the scarce resource.

**Software is not code. Software is realized intent.**
A system is not defined by the artifacts that implement it,
but by the accumulated intent that has been made true.
Code is a realization of intent.
Tests are evidence of intent.
Architecture is an emergent property of intent.
When execution is cheap, meaning becomes primary.

**Intent has an irreducible atomic unit.**
There exists a smallest unit of intent that is:
behaviorally precise
observable
falsifiable
independent of implementation
This Intent Atom is the final human-authored truth before mechanization.
Anything larger is composition.
Anything vaguer is prose.

**Code also has an irreducible atomic unit**.
Executable behavior is validated, not described.
A unit of code is not defined by its size or structure,
but by the validators that constrain it.
Tests are not documentation.
They are proof.

**Validators are the true substrate of software.**
Intent without validation is aspiration.
Code without validation is folklore.
Atoms gain force only through validators.
Everything else—plans, specs, tickets, architectures—exists to help humans and agents reason at scale.
They are scaffolding, not truth.

**There is exactly one semantic phase shift.**
Before commitment:
ambiguity is valuable
exploration is safe
meaning is fluid
After commitment:
interpretation freezes
obligation begins
determinism is enforced
This boundary must be explicit, auditable, and human-authorized.
The system may say “no” only here—and only to invariants.

**Higher-order constructs are real—but only as emergent properties.**
Collections of intent atoms do not introduce new semantics.
Systems do not gain new rules because they are large.
What changes is cognition, not meaning.
We reject ontologies that elevate convenience into truth.

**Agents change execution. They do not change responsibility.**
Agents are the prime movers of realization.
Humans are the prime movers of intent.
Agents propose, execute, and validate.
Humans decide, commit, and accept.
This is not a reduction of human agency.
It is its clarification.

**The industry must change its language.**
“Specs” are not truth.
“Stories” are not intent.
“Tickets” are not commitments.
These artifacts persist because we lacked better primitives.
We now have them.

**We are building systems for the next era of software.**
Systems where:
intent is explicit
boundaries are enforceable
validation is first-class
execution is mechanized
evidence is permanent
Systems that do not collapse under scale, agents, or time.

**This is not automation of developers.**
This is the elevation of meaning.
Software has always been about intent.
We are simply done pretending otherwise.
